#### ECE665 Algorithm Final

1. Graphs

   ##### Resresition

       > Martix
       
       > Adjacency List

   ##### Graph Traversal

       > BFS && DFS  (Sudo-code, Trace the code, Simple Program Solving using Graph Traversal)
       
       > Bi-connectivity 
       
       > Solve useing DFS

   ##### Directed Graph < DAG ( No cycling. )>

       > Do DFS && BFS
       
       > Strong connectivities. < Go from a to b and can also go from b to a ==> Transform this problem in different ways. >.
       
       > Transit Closer.. < How many node can reached from node i through the direction of the grapg.>

   ##### DAC ,

       > Topological Sort, < Sort with value on nodes> ==> 

   ##### Weighted Graph ( Every edge has a weight)

       > Shorstest Graph. < Directed G // Un- G> ==> Dynamic Programming. 
       
       > Min Sapning Tree ( MST)  ==>  < Find a MST from a G > .. 
       
       > Multi-commmodity Flow. ( No code. ) < How it works and the princples. >     

2. NP-Completeness  << Classfity Algorithms as complexity. >> 

   ##### P => Solve in pol-time. && NP => A set of problem that can be checked in pol-time.

          > NP-Completeness << Classfity Algorithms as complexity. >>

   ##### P => Solve in pol-time. && NP => A set of problem that can be checked in pol-time.

          > p within np.
       
          > Not all the NP problem can be solved in pol-time.
       
          > To find out wheather is P or NP.
       
          > Can transfer from NP to P.

3. Dynamic Programming.

   ##### Describe a bigger problem in a smaller problem.

          > Key: Catch the prm that can devide the problem into a small set of easy problem. << Not have a lot of para, but has sufficient enough>> 
       
          > Sub problems has overlap, if no overlap, then can be solved in recursive.
