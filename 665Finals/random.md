## Randomized Algorithms

1. We'd like to say "Algorithm A never takes more than f(n) times for an input size of N", this is Big-Oh notation and gives us worst case running time, a correct algorithm is a constructive upper bound on the complexity of the problem it solves.

2. Lower bound $\Omega (n)$

3. Randomized algorithm vs. Deterministic Algorithms:

   - Deterministic algorithms :

     - Takes at most x steps

     - Assuming input distribution, analyze excepted running time

   - Randominzed algorithms: 

     - Take x steps on average

     - Take x steps with high probability

     - Output "correct" answer with probability p

4. Other Randomized Algorithms 

   - Hashing: Universal Hash Function 

   - Resource Sharing

     - Rhternet Collision avoidance

   - Load Balancing

   - Packet Routing

   - Primality Test
